- 👋 Hi, I’m Owen
- 👀 I’m interested in developing transformative AI technologies that enhance safety, wellness, and impact. My focus areas include building the "immune system for AI" to make models more resilient and reliable, and creating **MyBuddy AI Coach**—an AI-powered wellness companion.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced AI methods in automation, data reliability, and user-centered design to optimize AI solutions for real-world use.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where AI can drive meaningful change, improve system robustness, or support personal and professional growth.
- 📫 How to reach me: Connect with me on LinkedIn or drop me a message here on GitHub to discuss potential projects and collaborations.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Outside of AI, I’m passionate about exploring new cultures, reading historical fiction, and challenging friends to a game of chess!
